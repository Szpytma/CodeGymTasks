<b>Java Syntax</b>

<b>The Java Syntax quest</b> was developed at the secret <b>CodeGym</b> center. It consists of<b> 10 levels</b> devoted to the fundamentals
of the <b>Java</b> language. It can be mastered even by someone who has never programmed before. You will learn about classes, objects,
methods, and variables. You will study basic data types, arrays, conditional statements, and loops. Take a quick look at <b>collections</b> and<b> OOP 
basics </b>(a serious study of these topics will begin in <b>Quest 4</b>), and start working in <b>IntelliJ IDEA</b>, a popular development environment 
used by programmers all over the world!

But most importantly, you will complete a lot of tasks. Tasks play a central role at <b>CodeGym</b>. And virtual mentors will help you 
deal with mistakes (Your solutions are checked instantly).
